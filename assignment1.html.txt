            For this assignment, I had to make 3 LED's blink using our Arduino. Below is the documentation!
            </p>
	<h2>Schematic </h2>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
	Shown on the schematic are 3 pins on the Arduino with an LED and resistor attached to each of them, which are also connected to ground. ****** change ***** (the second pin) has the order of resistor and LED reversed just to make it more visually interesting. The schematic also shows the values of the resistors, which I calculated using V=IR. For the red and yellow LEDs, as their voltage drop is 1.8V, the voltage that is being supplied is 5V, and the target current for LEDs is 20 mA, the resistors needed to reach that target current have to have a resistance of 160 ohms. For the blue LED, as its voltage drop is 3.2V, the resistance needed is 85 ohms.

	<h2>Code Snippet</h2>

	</p>
	<p>
	My code includes a setup method which runs once and prepares the pins on the Arduino for use by designating them as outputs, and a loop method which runs repeatedly and tells the pins to change voltage, thus turning the LEDS on and off. The loop method tells the pins to turn voltage to high one by one with a .333 second delay, turning on the red, blue, then yellow LEDs. It then turns the voltage to low with a .333 second delay between each pin, turning off the red, blue, then yellow LEDs.
