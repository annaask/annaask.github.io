            For this assignment, I had to use a input and output device, one of which using a library, to create something! I used a servo and a photoresistor to create a makeshift fan that spins between 0 and 180 degrees. it spins faster when it is bright (representing day and high temps), and slowly when its dark (representing night and low temps).

            </p>
        <h2>Schematic </h2>
            <p>
            <img src="LibrarySchematic.png" width=400></a>
            
                </p>
                <p>
                Shown on the schematic are 6 pins on the arduino. These pins are 5V, A0, 8, 9, and two seperate grounds. There is also a servo. Pin 5V is an outputing pin and is connected to a photoresistor, inputting pin A0, a 10k ohm resistor, and ground in a voltage divider configuration. Pin 5V is an outputting pin and is connected to the servo. The servo is also connected to a ground pin and pin 9 that sends it signals indicating what position to have the servo in.
                </p>
                <p>
                The schematic also shows the values of the resistor. For pin 8, I used a 10k ohm resistor on the other side of the voltage divider. This was based on the Adafruit Photocells informational document. As it described that higher resistance resistors would allow the photoresistor to be more sensitive to changes in low light, I decided to use a 10k ohm resistor as I am more able to control how dark the area is instead of how especially bright it is.

                    <p>
                    This code is similar to the code I used for assignment 3, input and output.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My code includes a setup method which runs once and prepares the pins on the Arduino for use by designating them as outputs/inputs, and configures the sensor to read values for the area it is in. There is also a loop method which runs repeatedly and tells the pins to change voltage based on sensor values, changing the brightness of the red and blue LEDs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Before the setup method, 5 variables are initialized. These variables are sensorValue, sensorMin, sensorMax, and Vread. The first three variables aid in determining the maximum value the sensor should read in the environment it’s in. The last variable defines a name for a variable that stores the position of the servo. The servo instance is also initialized as myservo. The servo library is also setup using #include
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The setup method first sets up myservo to be attached to pin 9. Then it sets the sensorValue, sensorMin, and sensorMax variables to 0, the max, and the min readable values, respectfully. Then the serial port is set up to transmit data at 9600 bits per second. Then the pins used for the circuit are set up to be input and output pins. Pin 8 is turned on so the photoresistor will get 5V of power. The set up method also includes a calibration section. Sample code here is drawn from the “Calibration” Arduino example. It determines the maximum and minimum values recorded by the attached sensor (in this case a photoresists) over a time period (here, 5 seconds). I then added statements that print the max and min to the serial port for debugging purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The loop method first sets pin 8 to output 5V of power, then it sets the sensorValue variable to read the Vread pin. It then uses the sensVal variable and the constrain method to restrict values that are used to ones that fit the range found in calibration. The map function is then used to map the values in sensVal to ones that can be used with LED, which are in the range of 0 to 255. The mapped value is set to outVal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     A phrase indicating whether it’s bright or dark will print to the serial port depending on outVal. If it's 255, it will print that it is bright, and if its 0 it will print that it is dark. If it’s not at max or min brightness, neither will light and the phrase “It's somewhere between dark and bright!” will print to the serial port.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Then the servo will be told how to spin. First, variable s will be assigned based on the value of outVal. If outVal is above 128, which means its brighter than it is dark, then s will be set to 2, meaning that the servo will spin faster. If outVal is under 128, which means its darker than it is bright, then s will be set to 10, meaning that the servo will spin slower. Portions of this code is sample code from the "Sweep" arduino example code.

                            For the servo, it is connected to the 5V pin, (coordinating to the red wire), pin 9 (orange wire), and ground (black/brown wire). For the photoresistor, the circuit is first connected to pin 8, providing it with 5v of power. Then it is connected to the photoresistor, then a wire connected to A0 for reading the values the sensor gives off. It is then connected to a 10k ohm resistor, then connected to the negative row of the breadboard and ground on the arduino.
